The Project Brief
Context of the Brief Measuring a person’s response to an external stimulus is a vital part of research in a wide variety of fields.

A reliable system for measuring a person’s speed of reaction or indicating the strength of their memory is required for areas such as:

• The effect of sleep deprivation

• Analysis of the effects of aging

• Effects of drugs such as alcohol or caffeine

• Sports science

• Effects from prolonged time online or using social media.

 

Below are some examples of reaction time tests, memory tests, and various other tests, along with information on factors affecting response times. Reaction time tests, visual and memory tests are available online.

Reaction time tests are used as part of sports science.

The Task

In this context, design a computational artefact using a program written in Python, that presents a self-explanatory user interface to measure the response of the subject (user) to a stimulus. The artefact should be measuring speed of response to simple or more complex stimuli and/or accuracy of memory.

The stimulus could be one of more of the following, or a mixture of similar types of response tests.

• Binary responses (selecting one of two options)

• Multiple responses (selecting one or more of many options)

• A visual or audio stimulus that triggers a response in the user

• A memory test.

 

Basic Artefact Features
1. A program written in Python, that interfaces with the user to perform a measurement of the user’s response to a stimulus, or a set of stimuli.

2. Multiple instances of data are stored in a file or Firebase.

3. The user’s performance is analysed and compared to an appropriate dataset, and presented in a suitable fashion, such as tabular or graphical form.

Advanced Artefact Features

4. An interactive system that displays multiple users’ data from Firebase, in a user-friendly and informative manner. The database is updated with each user interaction.

5. The artefact captures more than one type of performance measurement (such as reaction speed and accuracy of response; reaction speed and memory accuracy).
